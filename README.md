Hi there! 👋🏻
Hi! I'm Juan Ignacio Freire Angrisano, a high school student currently studying Computer Science at Instituto La Salette in Argentina. After graduating, I plan to continue my education by studying Information Systems Engineering at UTN (Universidad Tecnológica Nacional).
I'm passionate about programming, especially web and game development, and I'm always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
